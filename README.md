# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup

1) Clone this repository
   
2) Install postgress: https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/pginstaller-install-postgresql/

3) npm run db

4) npm run up 

5) npm run dev 

6) Change te variables: DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD on .env file to your DB user and password


*: I know it's not a good practice to leave .env vars on repos, but I did it so that it would be easier for you to test
